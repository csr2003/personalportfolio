# personalportfolio
creating a Personal Portfolio Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In this project, I learned how to design a Personal Portfolio Website that showcases my skills, projects, and services, along with an About section. I focused on creating an attractive and visually appealing layout to capture visitors' attention.

The website includes:
- A Home page with a captivating headline, professional photo, and a summary of my skills.
- An About Me section detailing my background, education, and professional experience.
- A Services section outlining what I offer.
- A Projects section highlighting my work.
- A Contact section for easy communication.
